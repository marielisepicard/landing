            taken: <b>I would become a developer</b>. So I made a career switch
            and joined 42.

            I started studying software engineering at 42 in 2019, working on a

            super exciting. After that I worked on

            I also did two internships to gain more experience and increase my

            When coding, I prefer using

          <li>
            <b>perseverance</b>: learning computer science from scratch made me
            learn to always keep going when things become difficult. I
            understood that facing complexity is part of the process (and is
            even enjoyable).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>autonomy</b>: I learned to organize my time, set goals without
            any supervision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>strengthen self confidence</b>: watching myself learn all these
            skills increased my trust in my ability to make great things.

            <b>responsibility</b>: I'm convinced that being able to question
            everything that we do is a very powerful lever to improve your
            skills and work methods so I'm trying to apply this questioning as
            much as I can.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>learning</b>: computer science has no learning limit and that‚Äôs
            what passionates me.

          <li>
            <b>sharing</b>: building a product is a team project. Sharing and
