        <div id="content">
          <p>
            After pursuing my Masters Degree at <b>Sciences Po Bordeaux </b>
            where I specialized in Business Management, I started my career in
            the Banking industry. After a couple years, I realised that I had a
            growing interest in new Technologies and I decided to
            <b>learn coding by attending the Piscine at 42</b>
            (a one month trial program). I loved it so much that my decision was
            taken: <b>I would become a developer</b>. So I made a career switch
            and joined 42.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started studying software engineering at 42 in 2019, working on a
            lot of <b>C projects</b> to learn the basics of computer science.
            All of this was new but super exciting. After that I worked on
            <b>multiple web projects</b> alongside other 42 students. For
            instance we made a <b>dating web app</b> as well as a
            <b>mobile app</b> focused on creating a new music experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also did two internships to gain more experience and increase my
            efficiency. My last experience ended in December 2021: I spent six
            month at <b>Jitter</b> (YC 2020), a startup building an
            <b>amazing motion design tool</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When coding, I prefer using
            <b>React, NodeJS, TypeScript and Swift</b> but I also love learning
            new languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I don‚Äôt code, I enjoy learning new stuff, listening to (tons
            of) podcasts or undertaking sport and intellectual challenges. I‚Äôm
            also an active member of <b>42 Entrepreneurs</b> . I help organize
            various events (such as <b>Hackathons</b> or
            <b>Startup Pizza Night</b>). I also write a monthly newsletter to
            share news about the startup ecosystem or communicate on our
            upcoming events.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              My main objective today is to bring my fullstack skills to a
              challenging and technical project while deepening my knowledge.

        <div id="content">
          <li>
            <b>perseverance</b>: learning computer science from scratch made me
            learn to always keep going when things become difficult. I
            understood that facing complexity is part of the process (and is
            even enjoyable).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>autonomy</b>: I learned to organize my time, set goals without
            any supervision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>strengthen self confidence</b>: watching myself learn all these
            skills increased my trust in my ability to make great things.

        <div id="title">MY CORE VALUES:</div>
        <div id="content">
          <li>
            <b>responsibility</b>: I'm convinced that being able to question
            everything that we do is a very powerful lever to improve your
            skills and work methods so I'm trying to apply this questioning as
            much as I can.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>learning</b>: computer science has no learning limit and that‚Äôs
            what passionates me.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>sharing</b>: building a product is a team project. Sharing and
            learning altogether is also what‚Äôs making me enjoy software
            engineering.
